# Xmetal's Android Box Setup Scripts

This is intended to be a script for myself, making an intial setup (or post firmware flash setup) alot faster and setup at least in general the way I like.

## Stage 1 - Remove potentionally dangerous code

- source: [https://github.com/DesktopECHO/T95-H616-Malware](https://github.com/DesktopECHO/T95-H616-Malware)

## Stage 2 - Remove unwanted apps that weren't removed in Stage 1

- Apitiude App Store
- Apkpure App Store
- Kodi/KMPlayer
- Amazon Prime
- Netflix
- Google Chrome

## Stage 3 - Install Apps from the Google Play Store or at least are IN the Google Play Store for later updating

- Kodi 19.5 
  - I have had issues with 20.0, 20.1, 20.2 with playback randomly stopping, or Kodi crashing
    - This is why i am sticking to this version for now
- Smarttube
- Spotify for Android TV
- MyRadar 4.30 (?? version)
- Background App and Process List

## Stage 4 - Fdroid related

- I hear that if you install downloaded APKs from F-droid it will not give you notices on updates like the Aurora or Google Play Store would.  I have looked into say (forgot the name but it was a github page)

- Apps from F-droid wanted, besides "F-Droid itself"
  - Rethink Firewall
  - SuperFreez
  - 

## Stage 5 - Restore Kodi settings

- How to do this without including my settings in this repo maybe an issue
