# Idea: put apks in repo and then i can just link to my own downloaded apks 

install:
    - wolf Launcher
        - atv launcher (if its easier to get the URL for this)
    - Kodi 19.5
    - TubiTV
    - PlutoTV
    - Spotify For Android TV
    - Pandora for Android TV
    - Kanopy 
    - Hoopla 
    - Background app and process list 
    - SmartTube 
    - F-Droid
        - * remember apks installed this way do not get updated via f-droid ... i think
        - rethink
        - aurora store
        - superfreeze
